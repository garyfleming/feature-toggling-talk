feature-toggling-talk
=====================

A pecha kucha talk I first gave at TechMeetup in Glasgow (August 2013).

I originally wrote them using an HTML-based tool, but I've now converted them to
markdown. Specifically, they're designed to be viewed using Deckset.

The slides themselves are intentionally sparse, but the raw source (feature-toggles.md) contains my notes for the talk. I've yet to change the content, so I'm sure
there are some things with which I no longer agree. YMMV.

# Variants

There is one major variant of this talk, Deployment is not Release.

It was created as a slightly longer and broader version. It's in the [deploynotrelease branch](https://github.com/garyfleming/feature-toggling-talk/tree/deploynotrelease).
