feature-toggling-talk
=====================

A pecha kucha talk I gave at TechMeetup in Glasgow (August 2013).

The slides themselves are intentionally sparse, but the raw source (index.htm) contains my notes for the talk. While it was revised a little on the day, these notes provide a fair representation of the talk. A slightly tweaked version of the notes is in talk.txt.
