# Feature Toggling

Originally, this was a Pecha Kucha talk I first gave at TechMeetup in Glasgow (August 2013).

Since then, I've given it a number of times at meetups and conferences, with fairly significant changes before each.

There is no definitive version but I'd say the two best variants are:

1. [Deployment is Not Release](https://github.com/garyfleming/feature-toggling-talk/releases/tag/v0.2) - Finalised at Lean Agile Scotland 2017. Probably the best general version of the talk. There is a [Deployment is not Release video](http://leanagile.scot/2017/sessions/index.php?session=61) (which I haven't watched), at the Lean Agile Scotland session page.
2. [Feature Toggling - Moving Safely in the Face of Change](https://github.com/garyfleming/feature-toggling-talk/releases/tag/v0.3) - The version I did at Agile Testing Days 2017, with more focus on testing. It's also intended to be a little more overstated, and a little more fun.

## Tooling

I originally wrote the slides using an HTML-based tool, but I've now converted them to
markdown. Specifically, they're designed to be viewed using Deckset.

The slides themselves are intentionally sparse, but the raw source (feature-toggles.md) contains my notes for the talk.

## Abstract

We want feedback sooner than ever before, while focusing on delivering value quickly and safely. What if we could deploy every commit but ensure everything keeps working? Let's talk about the backbone of continuous delivery: feature toggles.

In this session, we'll ensure everyone understands the basics of continuous integration and delivery, and then probe how feature toggles allow us to explore and experiment safely, while giving new capabilities to our organisations.
